# Personal Website
My personal portfolio built using Vue3 and a custom theme built with Tailwind.

## Getting started
Requirements:

* `node 18.12.1`
* `yarn 1.22.19`

Running the website can be done by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then you can access the site at `http://localhost:80`. There shouldn't be any other requirements since this project is meant to act as a static html site with no further requirements.
