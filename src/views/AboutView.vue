      <p>
        Hi I'm Josh Larminay. I'm a full stack developer from Victoria BC
        currently running my own company
        <a href="https://ursacreative.ca" target="_blank">Ursa Creative</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first got an interest in computer when I was playing Wolfenstein 3D on
        my grandpa's computer. I started with learning Macromedia Flash to make
        simple flash games. Unfortunately none of these games still exist today.
        During high-school, I started learning Python and HTML/CSS/JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high-school, I attended Camosun College for a year to learn
        computer science. After this I partnered with some friends to start our
        own company where I have been working since 2018.
