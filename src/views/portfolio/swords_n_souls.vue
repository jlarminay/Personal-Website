        <h3>Story.</h3>
        <p>
          With your soul transferred into your trusty sword, there is only one
          way to have your soul saved, 'The Angel Shrine'. You must find it
          quickly before your magic runs out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throw yourself towards your enemies and find a way to the mystical
          shrine for salvation.

        <h3>Development.</h3>
        <p>
          This project was made for the
          <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-70-heaven" target="_blank"
            >Mini Jam 70</a
          >. The theme was 'heaven' and the limitation was 'player must be an
          inanimate object'. This was my first time created a game, so I didn't
          really know what to expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up placing 5th overall and had a great time! I'm looking
          forward to participating in more game jams in the future. After the
          project was finished, I wrote a
